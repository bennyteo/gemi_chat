Found in nearly all meridians, the orange has developed different flavors, aromas, and characteristics reflecting the particularities of its terroir. From Brazil to Spain, Ghana to Morocco—Cointreau sources its sweet and bitter orange peels from respected producers before blending them to perfection.\n\nCointreau uses the following types of orange peels:\n1. Sweet Orange\nSweet orange peels and essences give to Cointreau their juicy, fruity orange aromatic notes, as well as a bit of floral such as orange blossom, rose, and lavender.\n\nThe sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) peels and essences used in Cointreau come from the Sevilla region in Spain, Ghana, Senegal, and Brazil. The major varieties are Cadenera, Salustiana, Pera, Late Valencia, Sweet Mediterranean, Washington, and a local Ghanaian variety.\n\n2. Bitter Orange\nBitter orange peels and essences give Cointreau a layered bouquet: initially fresh like mint or very zesty lime, then spicy bergamot, and finally pepper and cardamom notes.\n\nBitter orange peels and essences (Citrus auriantium ssp bigaradia), better known as Bigarade oranges today, come from Brazil and Tunisia. This orange’s leaf and flowers are also appreciated by the great “nez” of perfumery.\n\n3. Macerated Orange\nFresh sweet peels are macerated in a hydro-alcoholic solution for several weeks before their distillation in order to release their best aromas.",
